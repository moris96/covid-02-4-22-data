# COVID-19 Data 
## this is data pulled from [WorldOMeters](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) from March 24, 2022
### data shows country cases and deaths 
#### this is to demonstrate the cool things you can do with the pandas and plotly libraries with LARGE amounts of data, where I use the scatter3d in plotly go geo maps
##### all you have to do in order to see the map is fork & clone the repo (or just download the zip file if you prefer), and run the app.py file on your virtual enviorment 
##### for obvious reasons I have not included the API and Project tokens in the API data.py file
